### Complete the tasks below:

## ☒1. You should create a database named universe

## ☒2. Be sure to connect to your database with \c universe. Then, you should add tables named galaxy, star, planet, and moon

## ☒3. Each table should have a primary key

## ☒4. Each primary key should automatically increment

## ☒5. Each table should have a name column

## ☒6. You should use the INT data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key

## ☒7. You should use the NUMERIC data type at least once

## ☒8. You should use the TEXT data type at least once

## ☒9. You should use the BOOLEAN data type on at least two columns

## ☒10. Each "star" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in galaxy

## ☒11. Each "planet" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in star

## ☒12. Each "moon" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in planet

## ☒13. Your database should have at least five tables

## ☒14. Each table should have at least three rows

## ☒15. The galaxy and star tables should each have at least six rows

## ☒16. The planet table should have at least 12 rows

## ☒17. The moon table should have at least 20 rows

## ☒18. Each table should have at least three columns

## ☒19. The galaxy, star, planet, and moon tables should each have at least five columns

## ☒20. At least two columns per table should not accept NULL values

## ☒21. At least one column from each table should be required to be UNIQUE

## ☒22. All columns named name should be of type VARCHAR

## ☒23. Each primary key column should follow the naming convention table_name_id. For example, the moon table should have a primary key column named moon_id

## ☒24. Each foreign key column should have the same name as the column it is referencing
